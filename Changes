Revision history for CPAN-Meta-Requirements

{{$NEXT}}

    [ENHANCEMENTS]

    - Merging Module => 0 into requirements is now optimized

2.130     2014-11-19 23:25:46-05:00 America/New_York

    [ADDED]

    - from_string_hash can take optional constructor arguments

    [CHANGED]

    - bad_version_hook callback gets module name as well as version string

    - undefined/empty versions given to from_string_hash or
      add_string_requirement now carp and are coerced to "0" instead of
      being fatal.  This is more consistent with how the other requirement
      functions work.

2.129     2014-11-13 16:28:45-05:00 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - from_string_hash can now accept v-strings as hash values

2.128     2014-09-06 00:04:22-04:00 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Throws an error at compile time if neither version nor
      the ExtUtils::MakeMaker bootstrap are available

2.127     2014-09-04 22:17:44-04:00 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Works around limitations in version::vpp detecting v-string magic

    [PREREQS]

    - Requires version.pm 0.88 in metadata, but code should work with any
      version of version.pm

    - Adds support for forthcoming ExtUtils::MakeMaker bootstrap version.pm
      for Perls older than 5.10.0

2.126     2014-07-30 16:26:29-04:00 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Fixed compatibility with version.pm 0.77

    [DOCUMENTED]

    - Minor documentation fixes

    [CHANGED]

    - Modernized distribution meta files

2.125     2013-09-23 14:51:14 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - updated Makefile.PL logic to support PERL_NO_HIGHLANDER

2.124     2013-09-23 06:40:07 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Better fix than 2.123.  On old perls, rather than install into
      'core', we continue to install into the proper 'site' library,
      but force UNINST=1 when necessary to remove stale copies
      from ExtUtils::MakeMaker

2.123     2013-08-30 12:17:14 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - On Perls prior to v5.12, CPAN::Meta::Requirements will be installed
      into the 'core' library path to avoid an older version bundled with
      ExtUtils::MakeMaker and installed there taking precedence.

2.122     2012-05-02 17:29:17 America/New_York

    [FIXED]

    - Fix typo in documentation: the exclusion symbol is "!=" rather than
      just "!". The implemenation was correct, just the docs were wrong.
      [rt.cpan.org #76948; ticket and patch from hasch-cpan@cozap.com]

2.121     2012-04-01 15:05:15 Europe/Paris

    - Split out from CPAN::Meta into own distribution
